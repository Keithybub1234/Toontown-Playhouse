## PyDO - An Online Theme Park (OTP) Server Emulator

PyDO is an open source, re-implementation of Disney's Online Theme Park (OTP) server that powered their MMO's from 2001 - 2013. Built atop of the [Panda3D](http://www.panda3d.org) game engine and written in Python, PyDO is an easy to use, easy to debug solution for emulating said MMO's while also keeping speed in mind. PyDO is suitable for use with both Toontown and Pirates Online, but does NOT provide any game specific code. To learn how PyDO works, and how you can use it, vist the [Wiki]().

Thanks to PyDO's [BSD 3-Clause Licence](https://github.com/PyDO-Team/PyDO/blob/master/LICENSE), you are free to re-distribute and use this software in accordance with the licence.

PyDO is still very early on in its life, and while you're free to use it as you wish, we recommend holding off on using it in a production environment until it's first release.

### Building

As PyDO is written in Python, there is no need to build the source in order to use it. The only requirement is to have the latest, stable release of the Panda3D SDK installed. The latest version of the SDK can be downloaded [here](https://www.panda3d.org/download.php?sdk).

### Licence

PyDO is available under the BSD 3-Clause Licence. The terms of this licence can be found in the 'LICENCE' file contained within this repository.
